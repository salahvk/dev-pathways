Setting up AriaDocs is straightforward, with options to clone the repository or use the convenient `npx` command. AriaDocs requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher for optimal performance.

## Clone Repository
To get started, you can clone the AriaDocs repository directly from GitHub.

## Quick Setup with npx

For a faster setup, use the `npx` command to create a new AriaDocs project in one step:

```bash
npx create-aria-doc <project-directory>
```

**Command Output:**

```bash

Next steps:
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd <project-directory>
2. Install dependencies:

3. Start the development server:

```

With this setup, youâ€™ll have a ready-to-use AriaDocs instance to start building your documentation.
